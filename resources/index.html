<h2>Source Code Repository Access</h2>
<p>WinGup source code repository is available on GitHub:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/donho/wingup.git" target="_blank">https://github.com/donho/wingup.git</a></p>
<p>Your pull requests will be welcome. However, they are not always accepted for diverse reasons.<br /> Here are the guidelines for your pull requests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Respect Notepad++ coding style.</li>
<li>Avoid to commit several features in one commit.</li>
<li>Make your modification compact - don't reformat source code in your request. It makes code review more difficult.</li>
</ol>
<p>In short: The easier the code review is, the better the chance your pull request has to get accepted</p>
